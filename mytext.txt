1)

I assume I have enerated sinus arrival rate not sinus intergeneration time
how: generate a variable with poisson distribution a

if # of arrivals (lambda) are poisson distribution then inter arrival time is exponentially distributed
for each t get a sample from a poison distribution of poison(t)----
    this means changing the generator parametrs every time
    see if the relationship between lambda and poisoon(lambda) is linear, i mean 
       if lambda2/lamda1=mean(poisson2)/mean(poisson1) and variance 
       i mean if lambda moves linearly then mean of poisson move linearly
    what about exponentiall distribution?


2) how to find clusters at runtime


3) should i set service time over time or service time over packet?
